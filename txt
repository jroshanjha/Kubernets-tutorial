To deploy a Flask application and FastAPI-based ML model service using Kubernetes, you can create a microservices architecture where:

Flask app serves as the frontend/UI or main application logic.

FastAPI service serves as a backend ML API (model prediction, analytics, etc.).

Kubernetes (K8s) handles container orchestration, load balancing, scaling, and deployment.
